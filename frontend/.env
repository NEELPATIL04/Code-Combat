# Backend Configuration
# The app now auto-detects the environment:
# - localhost = Development mode (Vite proxy to http://localhost:5000)
# - Any other hostname = Production mode (nginx proxy to backend)
#
# No manual configuration needed! Just run:
# - Development: npm run dev
# - Production: npm run build (then deploy dist folder)
